# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Rust] + [Yew] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld] spec and API.


### [Demo]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld]


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged [WebAssembly] web application built with [Yew] including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Yew] community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld] repo.


# How it works

This is an application written in [Rust] that utilizes [Yew] and [WebAssembly] for developing the frontend web app that powers the RealWorld application.
